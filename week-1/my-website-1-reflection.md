Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
*go to you github account and go to your profile you should see right next to Contributions a button for Repositories, click on that and underneath on the very right side you should see a New button hit on that and it will take you to create a new repository, once there type down your repository name , add description if you like it is not a mandatory , but make it Public for sure , add a Licence and click Create a repositry button, there you go ! Once it takes you to your repository page we gotta clone it to your computer so we could work on it locally , what we'll do is go to the bottom og the repository page where you'll see HTTPS(SSN) clone URL, copy paste the link, and go to your terminal ,navigate to the directory  where you want to safe your repository and type : git clone paste your URL. Voila !once done you should be able to see it in your comp. files!

Describe what open source means.
* Open Source software (OSS) or sometimes a (FOSS)Free open source sof., software where with its source code made available with a licence (of corse you gotta agree of terms of use to be able to use it , which gives you some kind of piece in mind at least for me )in which the copyrights holder provides the rights to study change and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose . Software whose "source code" is available for modification by anyone licenced to suit his/her needs."Source Code"-is a part of the software that comp. users don't ever see, it is the code where programmers can manipulate to change, to make, share access to that code, add new features to make the program work correct. etc

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* At the beggining till i completlly got the licence part  i thougth how is this safe , i mean we deal with a lot of "hackers" lately they can use it  for something bad where everything could be gone in a second, but i read about the licence  some more and i felt much more secure about it where it allow me to see the good side of using it ,
i mean the source code is publicity accessible  for everyone who could benefit from it, we can learn to make better websites by studying what others have written , we could fix and improve a program by adding , fixing parts that they don't work correct, it does really help especially to us newbees to become better programmers ,  not only codes but everything we do, creating music, writing books , etc.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
* i think the most important part of it ,the stronger copyleft Llicence the safer you'll be and you should have a strong copyleft licence and work with a strong copyleft licenced people before you let others to build around your software because we live in a world that you don't know who you're dealing with , not to emphasize it but you really can't trust everyone about it.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* everything was way much easier this time except that when i was trying to push the html file i didn't go exactlly by the steps i feel, first i push it then when i went to the repo to the file i saw it there but i could't pull it i mean there was no option as it it was there so i don't know if i did it right !

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
* yes i definitelly did use other source like http://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source, and
