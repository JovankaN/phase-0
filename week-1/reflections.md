# 1.1 Think About Time

i definitely love the Pomodoro technique, first you set your timer to 25 min and take 5 min brake, and set as many timers as you will need to accomplish a given task and the best thing is to set 25min for recap and 25 for review ,that is amazing ! About productivity ides think meditation and yoga are one of the best , the less stressed and able to control your emotions the more organized you become and it is easier to focus on any given activity, the more focused you are the more productive you become! Timebox is a period that you and your pair (or coworker, or yourself..etc)agreed on to work os some project ,it could be the Pomodoro technique or some other technique , once you reach the time limit you stop and evaluating what you've accomplish rather then continuing to work until the job is done ! I could definitely use it when peer pairing in Phase 0 , give a timeframe once me and my pair would work on a assignment and stop once we'll reach the time limit and recap and review ! As of right now i study until i can focus on it once i am not fully there i stop! And i really don't think that is a good idea because sometimes i can cover a lot and i will not recap nor review anything and then once i go back to study i feel like i need to go through it again , so i will definitely try to use the Pomodoro technique it feels it is more effective on a long term, and in Phase 0 should definitely organize and set a goal for the day i'll study of a how much i will need to accomplish in that day before i even start and always leave time for recap and review!
## 1.2 The Command Line
So the way i understood "Shell"is a program that takes commands from you using CLI( command line interface), and gives them to the operating system to perform the given command , in other words shell is CLI itself ! Where "bash" is a unix shell and the command language where we type commands that causes action, also reads the commands, list them ,copy them etc. Thankfully i was able to use most of the commands given but i had some difficulties copy some of them from one to another directory ,i asked for help and thanks to those who helped me so now i got it covered, and i also   found  it harder to understand ,to change , print and set the environment with (env, echo,export ; ENV) don't know why ! As what is the most important commands and argument i would say most of them are ,maybe cd (change directory ) because i use it a lot to change the dir. where i'll be working, but i wouldn't point that out only because of it, so i stick to that all of them are important, besides the fact that they all have different meaning and take different action and can work together as well to perform action .    pwd- means to print the working directory;   ls- means to list directory ;  mv - to move a file or directory ;  cd- to change directory ;   ../- to move up in the path;  touch - to make empty files;  mkdir - to make directory;  less - page through the file; rmdir - to remove directory ;  rm - to remove a file;  help - if you forget the name of the command ,help looks through all the help files and find potentially relevant help for you!
### 1.4 Forking and Cloning
Think i got this ...So if you go to github account go to your profile page and on the right side at the top of the page you'll see a "+" button next to your avatar,so go and click it and press the New repository button, once you redirected , where  it says repository name type the one that you want to be working on , make it public so anyone can see it, add a  licence to your repo and click create repo to computer. That should take you to your repository .  Whats Fork- fork makes a copy of somebody's Github interesting repository that you'll want to have .Now you can Fork this repo (create a separate copy) of your own Github account.You can do that by searching the repo that you'll like to fork and it will take you to the other user github web. who made the repository, once there ,you click "Fork" at the top right of the repo page, once done it it'll ask you which user should the repository be Forked to and you should be able to see you username ,click on it and you should see your name at the top of the repository , now we know it is your copy! Now that it exist online we want to work on it but it has to exist in the computer as well to be able to do it, thats why we "clone" the repository! So first we open the terminal and make sure we are in the correct directory and set it so we are in the directory we want to clone the repository, then go to your github acc. and on the right side somewhere at the bottom you should see HTTS clone URL, (some SSN i believe) copy that URL and type in your terminal : git clone "paste the URL" hit enter (sometimes it ask you for username and password  you should type it in ,if not connected already) then  change the directory to that repository so you can list all the files in there and start working on it ! The reason why  i'll fork a repositories is probably because i'll want to add something else , want to change something , delete or it is so nicely done that i want to keep it to learn things from it, depends what you want to do! The struggles with Git and Github were because i didn't know who was lives locally in computer and who remotely on Internet , they are completely different, took me a while to get used to it , so pretty much you work locally,create code files  with git and  then you take it to github so you can keep track of everything you've done or in about to do ,and work with hundreds developers at the same time without overwriting it and messing up all wit github  thats how i got them at, and much more to learn about the since it is a bit confusing .
