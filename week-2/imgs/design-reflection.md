What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
* Information Gathering
* Planning
* Design
* Development
* Teting and Delivery
* Maintenance

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
* I think mainly webpage authored in HTML where it will have images, personal information , short bio, contact,email address ,link to resume, links to projects i've worked on or helped others to develop some of them etc. Would love to have quotes like my quotes that described some of my personality or beliefs etc.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
* I think it would be pretty much for anyone, no age and gender limit, since i think it will be a blog, i think it will be mainly for people who would want to read more about the path to become somebody successful, how to overcome those fears that can lead to a giving up your dreams etc.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
* I would want for most of the things to be easy to be seen not for them to go through a lot of searching or to take a lot of time to get to the desired info of course, however i would type down my whole resume but i would specify where a given link is to my resume, like i would make a intoduction page where i'll say how and where to find things like links images, etc.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
* Pretty much of how a person lets say me felt while i was interfacing with a website, a web application , a mobile application and yes some of them are not easy to follow. It is of big importance because if we didn't like how it looked like, was it a lot of time consuming, trouble finding enough resorces etc. we wouldn't give good feedback about it, or never visit the same website, web app again. So they would lose a lot of visitor and it would lead to failure. So we definitely want to make it more effitient and have better access and enough information of how to use the product that we've created.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
* ahh for sure how to display my image in my reflection file.
