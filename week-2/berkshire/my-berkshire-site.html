  Reflect on 2.6 

 -What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    It made sence why all those Markdown edditing practice, now that i know that HTML is a Markup Language, it definitely felt more adventurios, like omg what will happen if i put this text inbeetween those tags, what is the meanning going to be, how the site will look like, on which corner it will be etc. and all that text wrapped up inbeetween those tags it will give us different meanning each time.And when everything seemed to be working, indescribable happiness.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
   I believe we both used different resources which was awesome because it lead us to many possible ways of writing yet still getting the desired output.And we also had a situation where we tried to decide which semantic element is correct for the wanted outline but since we knew there are many ways we tried to use the ones that were most practical and suit the best.And i must say using those semantic elements deffinitely helped to adjust and gave us the desired outline.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
   Don't know if i understand the question right but definetly to keep my best practise i would start by putting the HTML structure,first by adding the Doctype then the HTML tag(open and closing tag),inside The html element create the body of it (again open and closing tag),inside the body probably use header to specify what the site is about then divide sections of how we want our site to look and the content we want to have,and the footer which is also part of the body as well.Those are the steps i kinda followed and it seemed like it worked pretty well for right now.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
   The good things is that you can be so creative with it in the way that you start writing down the words the way you imagined to appear on your page and able to play with it also being able to add links, images,videos etc. About the bad thing ..hmmm i haven't played that much around so i haven't experiences any problems with it so far , so for right i wouldn't say anything bad about it.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
   It deffinitely reminds me of human body kinda...you got the head, the body that consist of many parts and sections and finally your feet, lol , i guess that is why was super easy to follow the paths, but takes a lot of practise, to perfect it!
